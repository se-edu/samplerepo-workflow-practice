Hi I'm Xu Jun, year 2 computer engineering.
I studied in NJC, and before that SJI.
In NUS I have done some basic data structures and algorithms and know the basics of C, Java and Haskell.
       I am also currently learning digital design in Verilog.
       I am in USP which offers some eccentric and interesting modules.

That's about it. You could ask me out to play pool and I'll be happy to go.
